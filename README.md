# Translate-as-you-type

I made this as a way to translate on go.

Steps to use:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd890fd-dd96-4eaf-b7a4-33ea5983e25f)
1. Choose the input language. You can use Auto-Detect but it will more time delay.
2. choose he language you want to the text to be translated.
3. `Start Button` is the used as the the key to start taking the sentence.
4. `End Button` is the key that you should press to end sentence and as soon as you press the key it will start translating it.
5. `Clear Button` is the key that you  will use to clear the taken sentence
6. `Pause Button` is the key to pause the sentence and start doing other stuff.
7. `Application` is the title of window in which you want to use this app. (it is case insenstive and it will only check the word in title. So no need to type whole window name)
8. `Translator` You can use these various translators.
9. `Delete Start key` if you want to clear the start key also while translating
10. `Type via clipboard` it will copy the text into clipboard and paste it into the application instead of typing as a keys.
